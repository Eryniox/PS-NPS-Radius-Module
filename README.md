# PS-NPS-Radius-Module
A simple Powershell module for converting netsh NPS Radius commands to Powershell objects.

You can also get out a command with arguments to run, for updating (set) NPS using netsh. (No add yet.)

This module is created based on information from user "kosjubrmod" in this reddit post: https://www.reddit.com/r/PowerShell/comments/4dg20r/network_policy_server_how_do_you_add_a_policy/
